    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>My mother-in-law made this pie in Scotland. It is not a sweet mince pie, but it's easy to make, and a hearty dinner. I serve boiled parsley potatoes and a nice salad with this pie. My children always ask for this pie when they come home to visit.</p>
      <p>Serves 8</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1.5 pounds lean ground beef</li>

        <li>teaspoon beef bouillon granules</li> 
        <li>4 cups water to cover</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>0.25 cup water</li>
        <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Recipe Steps</h2>
